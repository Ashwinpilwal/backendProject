# Lets say we make refresh token(30day expiry) and access token(1day expiry), after 1 day we refresh token will itself generate access token and new refresh token, and it keep on going, every day new access and refresh token, they will never expire, it will cause issue

>   If you do this:

Login
├─ Access Token (1 day)
└─ Refresh Token (30 days)

Day 1:
Refresh Token A
    ↓
Access Token B
Refresh Token B

Day 2:
Refresh Token B
    ↓
Access Token C
Refresh Token C

Day 3:
Refresh Token C
    ↓
...

then yes, the session can theoretically continue forever.

But that's not because refresh token rotation is wrong. It's because of how you choose to implement session lifetime.

>   Strategy 1: Infinite Sessions (Common)

Many apps intentionally do this:

Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp Web...
You can stay logged in for months or years.

Every refresh:

Old Refresh Token
    ↓
New Refresh Token

The session keeps extending.

This is often called a sliding session.

>   Strategy 2: Absolute Expiration

Some apps say:

Access Token: 15 min
Refresh Token: 30 days

Maximum session lifetime: 30 days

Even if the refresh token is rotated, they track:

{
    userId: "...",
    sessionCreatedAt: "2025-01-01"
}

After 30 days: Force Login Again
No more refreshes allowed.

>   Strategy 3: Store Refresh Tokens in DB

Many production systems store:

{
    refreshToken,
    expiresAt
}

When refreshing:

if (Date.now() > expiresAt) {
    throw new ApiError(401, "Session expired");
}

Now rotation doesn't create infinite sessions.

> In my Code:

const refreshToken = user.generateRefreshToken(); 
refresh token expiresIn: "30d"

then every time you refresh, you're creating a brand-new 30-day token.
So yes, the session lifetime keeps extending.

That is a valid design choice, but it means:

Active user
    ↓
Never needs to log in again
until they logout or you revoke the session.



# If User get inactive for 31 days it will expire, 
>   Yes, day 31: Refresh Token expires. User needs to login again.

# But why are we even using and creating access token? just use Refresh token only

> If a refresh token already lasts 30 days, why not just use the refresh token for authentication on every request and forget access tokens entirely?

Technically, you can. But it's less secure.

Imagine using only one token
Refresh Token (30 days)

Every request:

GET /profile
Authorization: Bearer <30-day-token>

If an attacker steals that token: 
Attacker gets 30 days of access.

That's a huge problem.

>   Access + Refresh Token Approach

Instead:

Access Token  -> 15 min
Refresh Token -> 30 days

Normal requests use:

Access Token only

The refresh token stays hidden and is used rarely.

Request 1 -> Access Token
Request 2 -> Access Token
Request 3 -> Access Token
...

Only when the access token expires:

Refresh Token
    ↓
New Access Token
Why is this safer?

Suppose an attacker steals your access token.

Access Token expiry = 15 min

Worst case: Attacker gets 15 minutes.

Then it's useless.

If you used only a long-lived token: Expiry = 30 days

Worst case: Attacker gets 30 days.
Much worse.

> But remember: Always use access token(not refresh token) for secure routes. Otherwise there will be no purpose of two token approach.
